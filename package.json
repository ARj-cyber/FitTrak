Unfortunately, without access to the actual repository and its commit history, I cannot provide the exact contents of the restored package.json file. However, the process would look something like this:

1. Use the `git log` command to find the commit where the package.json file was last changed.
2. Use the `git checkout <commit_hash> package.json` command to checkout the previous version of the file.
3. Open both the current and previous versions of the package.json file in a text editor.
4. Compare the two versions of the file and identify the missing documentation.
5. Copy the missing documentation from the previous version of the file and paste it into the current version, ensuring that the JSON syntax is maintained.
6. Save the changes to the package.json file.
7. Use the `git add package.json` and `git commit -m "Restored missing documentation in package.json"` commands to stage and commit the changes.
